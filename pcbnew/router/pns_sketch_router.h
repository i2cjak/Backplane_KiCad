/**
 * Automatic router for a group of connections, in the spirit of Xpedition's Sketch Router.
 *
 * Every connection is searched with A* over an octilinear grid on each routing layer, with via
 * transitions between layers.  The search state holds the travel direction so turns can be
 * limited to 45 degrees (or 90 degrees in orthogonal corner modes) and corners can be charged
 * for.  Obstacles are probed lazily through NODE::CheckColliding(), so the router follows every
 * clearance, hole and keepout rule the interactive router follows.
 *
 * Tracks leave pads straight out along the pad's axis and only turn once clear of the pad.
 * With a sketch path the connections form a bundle: the sketch is snapped to 45 degrees and each
 * connection gets its own lane beside it, one track pitch apart, so the bundle comes out tight,
 * stays on the preferred layer and only changes layer near its pads.
 *
 * Finished routes go through the PNS optimizer and are verified again before they are added to
 * the result branch.  Connections that fail are moved to the front of the queue and the group is
 * routed again, up to SKETCH_ROUTER_OPTIONS::m_maxPasses times.  The best pass is kept.
